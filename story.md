## Session 1 - Jan 17, 2025

-   We met outside the adventurers guild and signed up together under the party name 'The Legion'. We then went to the associated tavern. The bouncer seemed to know Rattamis and Mara. Rattamis in particular got questioned about a mistress that he followed. The mistress in question was supposed to be killed. If Rattamis received further orders from his mistress, he was to report to the tavern bouncer (Veyra Noctis) immediately as it would mean that the mistress had become a witch and would need to be hunted down.
-   Vif got into (and lost) a drinking contest.
-   After listening to some fabulous tales told by Mr. Cluckington, the party helped clean up and then went to take a rest. Adventurers who are below silver rank can sleep at the tavern for free.
-   The rest was rudely interrupted by a necromancy student's experiment gone awry (again) and swarms of undead swarming around. The party got up to fend off the ended (emergency quest).

## Session 2 - Jan 24, 2025

-   Started in combat with ash zombies. My allies were dropping like flies. Only myself, Vif, and Distia were standing, all other allies had 0 HP. Upon praying to the god of paladins (Pal'Dina), a choir of monks began singing in my head, and I got the feeling that everything would be OK (allies got a free full heal. Also I got a nat 20 on the religion check). The ash zombies (4 of them left) then proceeded to surround me. The zombies then rolled really well (22, then a nat 20), and knocked me down. Distia crit killed 1 on 1 HP with starry wisp. The zombies, after gnawing on me, then proceeded to gnaw on Ratmatra. Ratmatra went down. (3 zombies were left btw). Vif fire bolt killed a zombie (only 2 remain). Drund and Distia then killed the last two zombies. Once the last zombie died, the headmistress (Elysia Lumina) came onto the field and gave us all a full heal (and a short rest)
-   After that whole fiasco, we finally arrived at the school of necromancy. It was very spooooky (dynamic fog vision). There was also a dead horse! (la di-dah di-dah). It was so spoopy that it was difficult to hear each other (sound didn't travel well).
-   After fighting off 2 zombie horses (only killed 1 of the zombies though), a mysterious lady with a greatsword came a long and slashed the remaining two zombie horses in half, killing them instantly. Elysia then comes by and gives us another heal. Elysia then tells us that the mysterious woman with a greatword is the one who summoned the zombies in the first place. We were only given the name "that bitch" for the summoner.
-   Upon returning to the adventurers guild, we were given rewards. Distia got a fancy wand, Mara got 66 gold, I got 91 gold, and no one else got anything (they failed their chance to get an item).

## Session 3 - Feb 07, 2025

-   We awake from our long rest to the sending stones we received from the guild ringing. An emergency has occured! Some Derro pirates are doing piratey things. We were warned that Derro pirates will simply flee if they feel endangered.
-   Also Distia took a sick day and isn't with is this session. Before we set out to vanquish the pirates, we go shopping! We find the hidden pact store, full of very expensive items. We got another message on the sending stone that some dire wolves have beaten a party of 4. Three of the party returned, while the leader became the dire wolf alpha's dinner snack. After a team vote, we set out to vanquish the dire wolves. After killing the wolves, we took a short rest, and Vif foraged for some berries. Whilst in combat with the pirates, the Derro captain melted Mara with acid, fully killing him. RIP Mara. Mara's final words were dissing Vif.
-   People got some treasure (I got a fancy shield, Vif a cool dagger, Alma (formerly Mara) some armor, and Ratmatra also got armor. Drund got 94 copper, Rattamis got 34 copper.)
-   We returned to the adventurers guild (with Alma in tow) to find it full of some 20 odd parrties. (Distia is still sick for this session, so we had some trouble getting in). Due to the overflowing guild, only Alma (the new female in the party) is allowed in. After the door slams in the face of the male members, I knock on the door twice, only to see a glyph of warding appear on the door. I take a step back. We were eventually let into the guild (thanks to completing the side quest of slaying the dire wolves) at which point we learnt that the quest to slay the Derro pirates was a grand failure across the board. Our rewards for completing the side quest was that Drund and Rattamis each got a weapon. (the rest of us failed our chance to get an item (had to get a 5 or lower this time)).

-   Also Mara (now Alma) started playing with a voice changer and god damn that thing is uncanny as all hell.

-   After getting items and goodies, we returned to the tavern. Veyra Noctis (the tavern lady) somehow knows the details of how the battle transpired... We also learnt that Noctis deals psionic damage (wounding the mind itself)
-   Veyra Noctis went to Ratmatra's room. I saw her walk in, and heard her leave a few minutes later.

## Session 4 - Feb 21, 2025

-   Some members left the part: Vif, Ratmatra (life things came up)
-   We welcomed some new members: Tyrah Lunarclaw, Vevinier Virleth, Asteria MaÃ«ra
-   Rattamis (and Drund) wasn't able to make session today, so he won't be here.

-   Vif went back to school after realizing that he was not an all powerful sorcerer.
-   In the morning I went to check in on Ratmatra, only to find him and all of his belongings missing..
-   We started with the Hook Horror quest.
-   Before going into battle with the Hook Horrors, we took a short rest and I gave some people temp HP, Myself, Tyrah, Vevinier, and Asterier (front liners, and squishiest). Made some baked potato in pita. I led the way in the dark cave with my bright glowing shield. I promptly got surrounded by young hook horrors. I lasted bravely, lasting a few turns. Got good use out of my chest beating, before I eventually got crit'ed down. I was brought back up and helped slay the rest of the yougins, before the Mama came out and knocked out both Distia and I in 1 turn. Alma crit Guiding Bolt on the Mama, dealing lots of damage. Asteria had been up and down a few times. Alma bravely distracted the Mama and ran away with it while Tyrah dragged me to the exit, and Vevinier dragged Asteria to the exit (we only needed to slay the young ones, not the mama!). It was a harrowing battle, Asteria constantly going down and me being unconsious (but stable) being dragged by Tyrah. Distia kept bringing Asteria back to life with her special wand. She then used the wand to cast AOE healing, bringing me, Vevinier and Asteria back to life! Distia then continued to drag the prone (but alive!) Asteria towards the exit. The Mama Hook Horror was still focused on Alma, way in the south west of the cave.
-   After a heartbreaking, and very brave, self sacrifice, Alma stayed behind to distract the Mama Hook Horror, allowing the rest of us to escape. Also Asteria went mad. Upon arising with madness, Asteria summons a witchbolt, and crits the Mama Hook Horror, dealing 50 damage, slaying the Mama Hook Horror. Distia grabbed the claw from the Mama Hook Horror as proof of our great acomplishment.

Bonus quest rewards for slaying the Mama:
Alma: Ring of Flickering Shadows (ring)
Asteria: Elusive Band (ring)
Distia: nothing
Ogo: nothing
Tyrah: nothing
Vevinier: nothing

No long rest at the end of session, ended outside of the tavern. We arrived back in town at dawn (next morning).

## Session 5 - Mar 07, 2025

-   Drund quit the group and we got a new Barabarian: Garrus Ashfall
-   From outside the tavern, we hear some voices - one being Silverpaw (the Tabaxi chef), Noctis talking and arguing with herself (?), and a gruff voice (that belongs to Garrus).
-   Upon opening the tavern door, we see.. two of Veyra Noctis.
-   One of the Noctis' turns into a vampire like creature (vampires don't exist)
-   Noctis starts to tell us to run, but before she can, _something_ happens, and we all go unconscious. As we began to black out, we see Noctis and Silverpaw reach out to start fighting the creature.
-   The creature reaches up and simply catches Silverpaw's knives. The creature grabs Silverpaw and flings her into the fireplace. (reminder that all retired adventurer are at least power level 20)
-   When we awake, 8 hours (a convenient long rest!) has passed, and everything is pitch black. The light from my shield is being completely blacked out. Those with darkvision in the party can barely make out the tavern in ruins. We then slowly notice that the entire town is on fire, yet the fire is not producing light. The only thing that casts light is a pillar from the sky that is casting light onto a single point on the city.
-   Noctis and the creature are both gone. Mrs Silverpaw is buried under some rubble, with her head exposed outside of the rubble.
-   Alma stumbles around in the pitch blackness and gets a few splinters.
-   All light sources are being completely muffled, and not casting much light at all.
-   Asteria (at the urging of the DM) is the first of us to look up, and observe the moon being blood red.
-   Distia and Rattamis recall that the Headmistress was a walking beam of lights with every step that she takes (from the necromancy quest).
-   Distia, Tyrah, and Garrus pull Silverpaw out of the rubble (with Tyrah not doing much with a strength check of 3)
-   Alma ritual casted Detect Magic, and after the ritual completes, the spell does not go off.
-   At this point, all our sending stones go off and say "emergency recall: all adventurers below power level 15 must return to the adventurers guild at once. Go to the beam of light."
-   About halfway to the guild, and suddenly we're blinded by the light of the sun (as we exit the zone of complete blackness)
-   Looking back into the zone of blackness, it looks completely normal. The city looks the same as always, no city on fire or anything. After another few steps, we enter another zone of darkness, and see the blood moon above us, and the city once more in ruins. From the bright areas, we cannot discern where the zones of darkness are.
-   Once we get to the guild, there's a bunch of other random people there (presumably other adventurers). The headmistress is standing half outside acting as a beam of guiding light. We, and all the other adventuters, are guided down to the dungeons. We also handed off Silverpaw to the guild higher ups. Then, all of us, except for Asteria and Vevinier because they have resistance, are magically put to sleep.
-   We all wake up 8 hours later, and we notice that people are leaving the cells. We see Mrs. Elara waving people on to go back to their normal lives. Asteria asks Elara what happened. Elara tells us that we were out for 24 hours. Noctis and some other retired adventurers went out to deal with a creature from the underdark who had transformed into Noctis and was going around biting people. Those bit just felt a bit tired in the morning. Noctis had walked into the tavern to see herself there. Noctis is also missing. Noctis has apparantly solo killed a Tarrasque (a world ending creature). I ask if Noctis has her sending stone on her, and Elara sayd that she might have left it in Garrus' backpack. His sending stone has been going off all night, so we don't really have a way of contacting her.
-   We got very little extra info about the Kruthik quest.
-   A dwarf (Kaseki) came by and told the guild that there are at least 18 young Kruthiks.
-   We enter the Kruthik caves, and Alma promptly ignores the plan to have the frontliners tank the damage, runs in, and gets knocked unconsious. The wall of the frontliners held strong, protecting the backline!
-   Something something fighting
-   Garrus kept getting nat 1's and hitting only Tyrah.
-   I picked up a Kruthik corpse
-   Session ended mid combat
-   Tyrah plans to use second wind next turn
-   There are 12 younglings that we have left to kill
-   Tyrah went unconcious and was brought back three times, so madness!
-   There is a javelin of mine on the ground

## Session 6 - Mar 14, 2025

Very short session due to life reasons and people not showing up (they had valid reasons). Garrus left due to life things (and will never be spoken of again). Combat quest ended early. We didn't get to complete the combat event.
Rattamis, Distia, Asteria - emerald
Ogo - amethyst
tyrah, alma, vevinier - blue saphire

Ogo and Alma both got a weapon from the reward.
We all level up to level 2.

## Session 7 - Apr 02, 2025

-   Asteria not here for this session.
-   We went back to the guild and in character knew we achieved power level two.
-   Ogo and Vevinier went to school to learn some new schools of magic.
-   We spent a day shopping/in school. The next morning, as we head back into town, we hear the sounds of combat.
-   New person! Ryuzen Ko, a fellow Enkoh! (monk) We find Ryuzen in combat with 3 drake bunnies, as well as an alhpa drake bunny. Combat ensues!
-   Upon defeating the alpha bunny drake, the last surviving small one enlarges, as it will soon evolve into an alpha (it got big, and in 1 turn, if not killed, it will become an alpha). With a great team effort, we slay the evolving drake bunny before the evolution is complete!
-   Vevinier deduces that the drake bunnies are a mutation, likely the cause of an experiment. They are from exiled experiments from the underdark (monstrosities).
-   These are the third underdark creature that we have seen (derro pirates, freaky Noctis look-a-like creature that destroyed the tavern, and now the drake bunnies)
-   quest rewards:
    -   500 gp (all)
    -   Alma: none
    -   Asteria (absent)
    -   Distia: wonderous item
    -   Ogo: none
    -   Rattamis: armor => I bought it off of Rattamis in exhange for 60% of gold rewards from this quest and the next 3 quests
    -   Ryuzen: wonderous item
    -   Tyrah: none
    -   Vevinier: wonderous item
-   Silverpaw sits down with us for our meal and gives us some lore on the tavern destroying underdark creature. There is more to the creature than they had originally thought. The creature is supposed to be extinct! It was a little bit less than 1000 years ago, that creature was a specieis of Dhampirs. The Dhampirs were humanoids that lived on the human continent but were heavily feared due to their unique eating habits. Dhampirs drink blood. The human killed all the Dhampirs. The peasents were tired of their cattle being killed (Dhampirs were kind enough to not attack the humans themselves). The peasents had an uprsising against the queen, and before she could respon, all the Dhampirs were eleminated, or so we thought. The Dhampirs are shapeshifters. Two ways to spot them: 1, they are shapeshifters, though many others are so that's not a big giveaway. 2: their eyes are red or pink. That is all we know as all the history books on them have been lost.
-   How were the peasents able to kill such powerful creatures? Power scaling was very different 1000 years ago, also it's very easy to kill someone when they are asleep.
-   The Dhampirs are not inherently evil and they should not be killed on sight.
-   Vevinier points out that we have seen many underdark creatures of late, and asks Silverpaw if we should be worried about an underdark uprising. Vevinier notices a rise in pitch when Silverpaw denies a potential problem, despite Silverpaw's steady eyes as she replies. Silverpaw hurries back to work at that point.Vevinier does **NOT** share that information.
