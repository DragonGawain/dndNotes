## Session 1 - Jan 17, 2025

-   We met outside the adventurers guild and signed up together under the party name 'The Legion'. We then went to the associated tavern. The bouncer seemed to know Rattamis and Mara. Rattamis in particular got questioned about a mistress that he followed. The mistress in question was supposed to be killed. If Rattamis received further orders from his mistress, he was to report to the tavern bouncer (Veyra Noctis) immediately as it would mean that the mistress had become a witch and would need to be hunted down.
-   Vif got into (and lost) a drinking contest.
-   After listening to some fabulous tales told by Mr. Cluckington, the party helped clean up and then went to take a rest. Adventurers who are below silver rank can sleep at the tavern for free.
-   The rest was rudely interrupted by a necromancy student's experiment gone awry (again) and swarms of undead swarming around. The party got up to fend off the ended (emergency quest).

## Session 2 - Jan 24, 2025

-   Started in combat with ash zombies. My allies were dropping like flies. Only myself, Vif, and Distia were standing, all other allies had 0 HP. Upon praying to the god of paladins (Pal'Dina), a choir of monks began singing in my head, and I got the feeling that everything would be OK (allies got a free full heal. Also I got a nat 20 on the religion check). The ash zombies (4 of them left) then proceeded to surround me. The zombies then rolled really well (22, then a nat 20), and knocked me down. Distia crit killed 1 on 1 HP with starry wisp. The zombies, after gnawing on me, then proceeded to gnaw on Ratmatra. Ratmatra went down. (3 zombies were left btw). Vif fire bolt killed a zombie (only 2 remain). Drund and Distia then killed the last two zombies. Once the last zombie died, the headmistress (Elysia Lumina) came onto the field and gave us all a full heal (and a short rest)
-   After that whole fiasco, we finally arrived at the school of necromancy. It was very spooooky (dynamic fog vision). There was also a dead horse! (la di-dah di-dah). It was so spoopy that it was difficult to hear each other (sound didn't travel well).
-   After fighting off 2 zombie horses (only killed 1 of the zombies though), a mysterious lady with a greatsword came a long and slashed the remaining two zombie horses in half, killing them instantly. Elysia then comes by and gives us another heal. Elysia then tells us that the mysterious woman with a greatword is the one who summoned the zombies in the first place. We were only given the name "that bitch" for the summoner.
-   Upon returning to the adventurers guild, we were given rewards. Distia got a fancy wand, Mara got 66 gold, I got 91 gold, and no one else got anything (they failed their chance to get an item).

## Session 3 - Feb 07, 2025

-   We awake from our long rest to the sending stones we received from the guild ringing. An emergency has occured! Some Derro pirates are doing piratey things. We were warned that Derro pirates will simply flee if they feel endangered.
-   Also Distia took a sick day and isn't with is this session. Before we set out to vanquish the pirates, we go shopping! We find the hidden pact store, full of very expensive items. We got another message on the sending stone that some dire wolves have beaten a party of 4. Three of the party returned, while the leader became the dire wolf alpha's dinner snack. After a team vote, we set out to vanquish the dire wolves. After killing the wolves, we took a short rest, and Vif foraged for some berries. Whilst in combat with the pirates, the Derro captain melted Mara with acid, fully killing him. RIP Mara. Mara's final words were dissing Vif.
-   People got some treasure (I got a fancy shield, Vif a cool dagger, Alma (formerly Mara) some armour, and Ratmatra also got armour. Drund got 94 copper, Rattamis got 34 copper.)
-   We returned to the adventurers guild (with Alma in tow) to find it full of some 20 odd parrties. (Distia is still sick for this session, so we had some trouble getting in). Due to the overflowing guild, only Alma (the new female in the party) is allowed in. After the door slams in the face of the male members, I knock on the door twice, only to see a glyph of warding appear on the door. I take a step back. We were eventually let into the guild (thanks to completing the side quest of slaying the dire wolves) at which point we learnt that the quest to slay the Derro pirates was a grand failure across the board. Our rewards for completing the side quest was that Drund and Rattamis each got a weapon. (the rest of us failed our chance to get an item (had to get a 5 or lower this time)).

-   Also Mara (now Alma) started playing with a voice changer and god damn that thing is uncanny as all hell.

-   After getting items and goodies, we returned to the tavern. Veyra Noctis (the tavern lady) somehow knows the details of how the battle transpired... We also learnt that Noctis deals psionic damage (wounding the mind itself)
-   Veyra Noctis went to Ratmatra's room. I saw her walk in, and heard her leave a few minutes later.

## Session 4 - Feb 21, 2025

-   Some members left the part: Vif, Ratmatra (life things came up)
-   We welcomed some new members: Tyrah Lunarclaw, Vevinier Virleth, Asteria MaÃ«ra
-   Rattamis (and Drund) wasn't able to make session today, so he won't be here.

-   Vif went back to school after realizing that he was not an all powerful sorcerer.
-   In the morning I went to check in on Ratmatra, only to find him and all of his belongings missing..
-   We started with the Hook Horror quest.
-   Before going into battle with the Hook Horrors, we took a short rest and I gave some people temp HP, Myself, Tyrah, Vevinier, and Asterier (front liners, and squishiest). Made some baked potato in pita. I led the way in the dark cave with my bright glowing shield. I promptly got surrounded by young hook horrors. I lasted bravely, lasting a few turns. Got good use out of my chest beating, before I eventually got crit'ed down. I was brought back up and helped slay the rest of the yougins, before the Mama came out and knocked out both Distia and I in 1 turn. Alma crit Guiding Bolt on the Mama, dealing lots of damage. Asteria had been up and down a few times. Alma bravely distracted the Mama and ran away with it while Tyrah dragged me to the exit, and Vevinier dragged Asteria to the exit (we only needed to slay the young ones, not the mama!). It was a harrowing battle, Asteria constantly going down and me being unconsious (but stable) being dragged by Tyrah. Distia kept bringing Asteria back to life with her special wand. She then used the wand to cast AOE healing, bringing me, Vevinier and Asteria back to life! Distia then continued to drag the prone (but alive!) Asteria towards the exit. The Mama Hook Horror was still focused on Alma, way in the south west of the cave.
-   After a heartbreaking, and very brave, self sacrifice, Alma stayed behind to distract the Mama Hook Horror, allowing the rest of us to escape. Also Asteria went mad. Upon arising with madness, Asteria summons a witchbolt, and crits the Mama Hook Horror, dealing 50 damage, slaying the Mama Hook Horror. Distia grabbed the claw from the Mama Hook Horror as proof of our great acomplishment.

Bonus quest rewards for slaying the Mama:
Alma: Ring of Flickering Shadows (ring)
Asteria: Elusive Band (ring)
Distia: nothing
Ogo: nothing
Tyrah: nothing
Vevinier: nothing

No long rest at the end of session, ended outside of the tavern. We arrived back in town at dawn (next morning).

## Session 5 - Mar 07, 2025

-   Drund quit the group and we got a new Barabarian: Garrus Ashfall
-   From outside the tavern, we hear some voices - one being Silverpaw (the Tabaxi chef), Noctis talking and arguing with herself (?), and a gruff voice (that belongs to Garrus).
-   Upon opening the tavern door, we see.. two of Veyra Noctis.
-   One of the Noctis' turns into a vampire like creature (vampires don't exist)
-   Noctis starts to tell us to run, but before she can, _something_ happens, and we all go unconscious. As we began to black out, we see Noctis and Silverpaw reach out to start fighting the creature.
-   The creature reaches up and simply catches Silverpaw's knives. The creature grabs Silverpaw and flings her into the fireplace. (reminder that all retired adventurer are at least power level 20)
-   When we awake, 8 hours (a convenient long rest!) has passed, and everything is pitch black. The light from my shield is being completely blacked out. Those with darkvision in the party can barely make out the tavern in ruins. We then slowly notice that the entire town is on fire, yet the fire is not producing light. The only thing that casts light is a pillar from the sky that is casting light onto a single point on the city.
-   Noctis and the creature are both gone. Mrs Silverpaw is buried under some rubble, with her head exposed outside of the rubble.
-   Alma stumbles around in the pitch blackness and gets a few splinters.
-   All light sources are being completely muffled, and not casting much light at all.
-   Asteria (at the urging of the DM) is the first of us to look up, and observe the moon being blood red.
-   Distia and Rattamis recall that the Headmistress was a walking beam of lights with every step that she takes (from the necromancy quest).
-   Distia, Tyrah, and Garrus pull Silverpaw out of the rubble (with Tyrah not doing much with a strength check of 3)
-   Alma ritual casted Detect Magic, and after the ritual completes, the spell does not go off.
-   At this point, all our sending stones go off and say "emergency recall: all adventurers below power level 15 must return to the adventurers guild at once. Go to the beam of light."
-   About halfway to the guild, and suddenly we're blinded by the light of the sun (as we exit the zone of complete blackness)
-   Looking back into the zone of blackness, it looks completely normal. The city looks the same as always, no city on fire or anything. After another few steps, we enter another zone of darkness, and see the blood moon above us, and the city once more in ruins. From the bright areas, we cannot discern where the zones of darkness are.
-   Once we get to the guild, there's a bunch of other random people there (presumably other adventurers). The headmistress is standing half outside acting as a beam of guiding light. We, and all the other adventuters, are guided down to the dungeons. We also handed off Silverpaw to the guild higher ups. Then, all of us, except for Asteria and Vevinier because they have resistance, are magically put to sleep.
-   We all wake up 8 hours later, and we notice that people are leaving the cells. We see Mrs. Elara waving people on to go back to their normal lives. Asteria asks Elara what happened. Elara tells us that we were out for 24 hours. Noctis and some other retired adventurers went out to deal with a creature from the underdark who had transformed into Noctis and was going around biting people. Those bit just felt a bit tired in the morning. Noctis had walked into the tavern to see herself there. Noctis is also missing. Noctis has apparantly solo killed a Tarrasque (a world ending creature). I ask if Noctis has her sending stone on her, and Elara sayd that she might have left it in Garrus' backpack. His sending stone has been going off all night, so we don't really have a way of contacting her.
-   We got very little extra info about the Kruthik quest.
-   A dwarf (Kaseki) came by and told the guild that there are at least 18 young Kruthiks.
-   We enter the Kruthik caves, and Alma promptly ignores the plan to have the frontliners tank the damage, runs in, and gets knocked unconsious. The wall of the frontliners held strong, protecting the backline!
-   Something something fighting
-   Garrus kept getting nat 1's and hitting only Tyrah.
-   I picked up a Kruthik corpse
-   Session ended mid combat
-   Tyrah plans to use second wind next turn
-   There are 12 younglings that we have left to kill
-   Tyrah went unconcious and was brought back three times, so madness!
-   There is a javelin of mine on the ground

## Session 6 - Mar 14, 2025

Very short session due to life reasons and people not showing up (they had valid reasons). Garrus left due to life things (and will never be spoken of again). Combat quest ended early. We didn't get to complete the combat event.
Rattamis, Distia, Asteria - emerald
Ogo - amethyst
tyrah, alma, vevinier - blue saphire

Ogo and Alma both got a weapon from the reward.
We all level up to level 2.

## Session 7 - Apr 04, 2025

-   Asteria not here for this session.
-   We went back to the guild and in character knew we achieved power level two.
-   Ogo and Vevinier went to school to learn some new schools of magic.
-   We spent a day shopping/in school. The next morning, as we head back into town, we hear the sounds of combat.
-   New person! Ryuzen Ko, a fellow Enkoh! (monk) We find Ryuzen in combat with 3 drake bunnies, as well as an alhpa drake bunny. Combat ensues!
-   Upon defeating the alpha bunny drake, the last surviving small one enlarges, as it will soon evolve into an alpha (it got big, and in 1 turn, if not killed, it will become an alpha). With a great team effort, we slay the evolving drake bunny before the evolution is complete!
-   Vevinier deduces that the drake bunnies are a mutation, likely the cause of an experiment. They are from exiled experiments from the underdark (monstrosities).
-   These are the third underdark creature that we have seen (derro pirates, freaky Noctis look-a-like creature that destroyed the tavern, and now the drake bunnies)
-   quest rewards:
    -   500 gp (all)
    -   Alma: none
    -   Asteria (absent)
    -   Distia: wonderous item
    -   Ogo: none
    -   Rattamis: armour => I bought it off of Rattamis in exhange for 60% of gold rewards from this quest and the next 3 quests
    -   Ryuzen: wonderous item
    -   Tyrah: none
    -   Vevinier: wonderous item
-   Silverpaw sits down with us for our meal and gives us some lore on the tavern destroying underdark creature. There is more to the creature than they had originally thought. The creature is supposed to be extinct! It was a little bit less than 1000 years ago, that creature was a specieis of Dhampirs. The Dhampirs were humanoids that lived on the human continent but were heavily feared due to their unique eating habits. Dhampirs drink blood. The human killed all the Dhampirs. The peasents were tired of their cattle being killed (Dhampirs were kind enough to not attack the humans themselves). The peasents had an uprsising against the queen, and before she could respon, all the Dhampirs were eleminated, or so we thought. The Dhampirs are shapeshifters. Two ways to spot them: 1, they are shapeshifters, though many others are so that's not a big giveaway. 2: their eyes are red or pink. That is all we know as all the history books on them have been lost.
-   How were the peasents able to kill such powerful creatures? Power scaling was very different 1000 years ago, also it's very easy to kill someone when they are asleep.
-   The Dhampirs are not inherently evil and they should not be killed on sight.
-   Vevinier points out that we have seen many underdark creatures of late, and asks Silverpaw if we should be worried about an underdark uprising. Vevinier notices a rise in pitch when Silverpaw denies a potential problem, despite Silverpaw's steady eyes as she replies. Silverpaw hurries back to work at that point. Vevinier does **NOT** share that information.

## Session 8 - Apr 11, 2025

-   Asteria not here for this session as well.
-   We awake to find our sending stones ringing! The monthly necromancy student is at it again!
-   On our way to the skeleton hunt, Vevinier informs us that Silverpaw was maybe lying about a potential Underdark uprising.
-   Very eerie and dark combat setting. I can't see any enemies, but I hear the long, extended breaths of.. _something_.
-   Turns out, there were three skeleton minotaurs! Tyrah, Rattamis, Ryuzen and I fight one of them (I miss my attack though). Ryuzen discovers that they're weak to bludgeoning damage. The second minotaur attempts to charge me (revenge for the first charge which missed!), but it got a nat 1 and killed the other skeleton minotaur. Distia, Alma, and Vevinier deal with the other one. Distia turned it into a glowing skeleton minotaur with Starry Wisp, so it went after them (glow didn't last for long though).
-   Then I crit, dealing a total of 59 damage in a single hit (that was our third nat 20, after they minotaurs got a nat 1 and attacked each other, so we've been pretty lucky this combat..)
-   After we defeat the trio of minotaurs, we encounter a trio of student (Bob, Billy, and Sarah). We learn that Lira (the necromancy student) summoned a Skeletal Naga, which then summoned the three minotaurs, and also kidnapped Lira. We also learn that Lira is the next queen of the Kitsune.
-   We arrive at the place where the three pointed us towards and notice that there's a lot of light..
-   Bone Naga boss scary. Also we have to kill it in one turn or it'll kill Lira. Also Bone Naga boss scary, but Distia could maybe 1 shot it all by herself!! (icy crown has some special powers..)
-   I got the idea to use Santuary on Lira, but wasn't close enough, so Distia's plan got delayed by a turn.
-   I missed my attack (nat 1), Ryuzen tried to help Lira, and failed. Distia casts her spell, and the Naga succeeds on its save, so it only took half damage. Vevinier missed her prepared spell, Rattamis missed their attack, Alma _also_ got a nat 1 and hit Tyrah.
-   And then we somehow manage to kill it.
-   quest rewards:

    -   500 gp (all)
    -   500 gp (total, team chest)
    -   Alma: wonderous item
    -   Asteria (absent)
    -   Distia: none
    -   Ogo: none
    -   Rattamis: none
    -   Ryuzen: none
    -   Tyrah: none
    -   Vevinier: none

-   We go and do some shopping, and Vevinier has a special relationshipwith the owner of the Umbragen Accord shop (the shopkeeper is also a shadow elf)
-   We also get a special deal at the wolfkin shop (cause of Tyrah)
-   As we wrap up our shopping, we get a message on the sending stone: "We have secured lodging for you outside of the dungeons." The name of the new tavern is "The Gilded Bough".

## Session 9 - Apr 18, 2025

-   Pre-session: Long term goal talk
-   Distia not here (? no message about it, but wasn't here for session..)
-   Vevinier leaves the party due (player left the campaign)
-   We are served shadow wine with our meal (imagine coke, but spicy. Like, jalapeno powder) (it is non-alcoholic)
-   Asteria goes to have a chat with 3 sun elves.
-   Alma feels like they're being watched from above, and looks up, just to see a pink sparkle disappear.
-   Velvyra (owner) hasn't moved since we entered the tavern, and her irises are white.
-   I learn that she is blind.
-   I ask her if she knows of the current state of the Underdark, and she instead offers to answer any one question from each of the party memebers. Each question is asked privately.
-   I ask what evils have been attempting to invade this plane (the plane that we live in)
-   She answers as follows:
    -   West, underdark queen bringing dhampirs back
    -   South, Demons against tieflings
    -   North, fallen angels
    -   East, nothing as of yet
-   She then follows up by saying that she is disappointed that I did not ask the right question.
-   Asteria asked her question next. She elects to not share her question/answer with the party yet, appearing somewhat daze.
-   Rattamis asked how to gain the favor of his queen.
    -   He was told that he will need to open up a portal to his homeland.
-   Ryuzen asked how to return the Enkoh people back to the Feyland.
    -   His character does not really remember the answer.
-   Tyrah asked when we will meet our next major foe.
    -   The answer was that we will meat a lich under the moonlight.
-   Lastly, Alma elected to not share their question/answer.

-   Asteria walks into the taver (?). Velvyra's eyes are now amber and she seems confused, and she asks Asteria, who just walked in, to approach. Velvyra asks Asteria "where am I?", to which Asteria replies "The Gilded Bough" (name of the tavern).
-   V asks who owns it, A: you do
-   V: What is this tavern? A: This is your refuge, a neutral territory for tired travelers to stop and rest.
-   V: I see. It feels like I've been standing ehre for a while. Do you know how long I've been standing here? A: Uncertain, but for as long as I have been here.
-   Velvyra begins to wander. Asteria asks if she needs any help/assistance, which causes her to pause.
-   V: What year is it? A: 2025 (IRL year drop)
-   V: That can't be possible. I returned from Celestia in 2015. A: I'm sorry that you seem to have lost time, but in that time, you have seemed to done great things. I hope that makes you feel better.
-   V: It does make me feel better. All I have is my faith as a Paladin to my goddess (dark goddess, she is a Drow). A: Something something "may your goddess be blessed".
-   Velvyra begins to wander once more.
-   Alma asks what happened with the whole memory loss thingy. Asteria know that speaking about that whole conversation, along with the info she got from her private question, would be best communicated in private. Asteria communicates that it'll be explained later.

-   Rattamis goes to dance to the music, and feels the gaze of a rather lustful sun elf (who gave Asteria an upgrade in their earlier discussion).
-   We go up to Asteria's room to discuss things that should not be spoken about in public. Alma stays behind.
-   Asteria elects to not share much until we are outside of city limits, but does share that the bartender is OK. And that the owner plays a very important part in the grand scheme of things. We should be on the lookout for a full moon and a lich.

-   We take a long rest (sleep), and wake up to emergency quest time (again, yay!) Evocation student disaster this time.

-   On the way to deal with the disaster, Asteria shares the rest. Asteria's question was about why Velvyra started the Gilded Bough, and what part the moon played. Asteria was whisked away and learnt that Velvyra is a vessel for the Dark Mother (dragon goddess of the Drow).
-   Asteria was told to look for the bastion under the full moon in the darkness, and that we would need to defeat the lich in the basement.

-   Combat time! We arrive at the evocation school and do combat things. (DM said some ominous things like "time to die" and "good luck". Also "no one will die tonight, but we will wish that we had").
-   Tyrah, Alma, and I all immediately become paralyzed. (the rest of the party is stealthed and not spotted)
-   I then get stunned for, hem hem, 90 turns (short term madness). And therefore, since I'm stunned, cannot take any actions.
-   The enemies we fought didn't really attack us, but they did just continuously paralyze the whole party. And cause madness.
-   Enemies finally started attacking after every party member was paralyzed.
-   DM is kind and broke my stun 85 turns early! (yay!)
-   Also god damn these paralyze guys are suuuuper annoying.
-   I then instantly got paralyzed again. Sad.
-   Oh yeah, also, they seem to be immune to purely physical attacks.
-   I then entered a cycle of getting paralyzed, and unparalyzed, then paralyzed, then unparalyzed, etc a few times.
-   After 12 rounds, we find the student who snaps the aberations out of existance.
-   We each get lots of money (1000 gp each), and we meet Mrs. Silverpaw.
-   Silverpaw tells us about King Midas.
-   The animal people all come from the Feywild. There's a bloody war on the animal kingdom continent. When all beastkin arrived to the mortal plane, we were banished to what is now the animal kingdom. But there was an issue. In each city, there is a population of roughly 1 million (per species). At the time of banishment, there were about 1 billion of each species. There simply was not enough space or resources on the contenent, and thus ensued the Billion Death War. This war was caused by a king. In the feywild, a king of all species was chosen. King Midas was crowned at noon. At 5:00 pm, all beastkin were transported to the mortal plane. We don't know what happened to cause this interspecies-wide banishment, but it sure did.
-   Tyrah went mad and started loving books, so Silverpaw drew an S on her forehead. Tyrah went unconscious and a dragon mark appeared. That mark is why no males can become leaders. Only females have the mark, and it makes them stronger and stuff. Ask a god for more info. Silverpaw let go of Tyrah foreheads, and she regained consciousness. With enough faith, you can speak to the gods in their temples.
-   At each school, there is a shrine to each of the gods. That shrine is not the temple. Only once you have proven yourself to the god can you enter the temple.
-   (At this point, I learn that Cluckington is dead, killed for giving out info about the bastion)
-   Asteria asks Silverpaw about the bastion, and everyone, except me cause I rolled too high, feels a presence watching us. Rattamis instantly casts detects magic, and discovers that a scry spell had been cast. Silverpaw, with great visibly showing fear, stands up and silently leaves the room.
-   Bonus rewards:
    -   Alma: none
    -   Asteria: none
    -   Distia: absent
    -   Ogo: none
    -   Rattamis: none
    -   Ryuzen: none
    -   Tyrah: Wonderous item (crit!)
    -   Vevinier: none

## Session 10 - Apr 25 2025

-   We awake from our long rest in the tavern (with the entire party present for once!) and Distia's sensing stone goes off with the [Panthrgoon quest](./quests.md#panthragoon-hunt-needed)
-   We start off the session with some RP, with a focus on the permanent madness' that we got last session (except for Distia, who got away unscathed being absent last session, and thus avoided getting afflicted with a permanent madness).
-   The discussion is uhh.. very funny but too complex to write down. (madness talk)
-   After being urged to go to the school of Abjuration to try to get our madness' fixed, we make our way there with some more.. colourful discussion.
-   Insert laughter and silliness hear, as Distia leads the entire party like a family of little ducklings.
-   Distia is fine, Asteria feels fine (therapy suggested), Alma sees birds, Tyrah is obsessed with a book and wants to cast fireball, Ogo is impressing to everyone that he's glowing (literally!), Rattamis sees bugs crawling all over everybody, Ryuzen is very emotional.
-   We eventually find our way to the Remove Curse clinic. The clerk at the Remove Curse clinic suggests Break Curse be cast on Ogo, Rattamis, Tyrah, and Alma. They suggest therapy for Ryuzen.
-   After having Remove Curse cast on the four of us, nothing changed. The clerk is confused and apologizes, but doesn't know how to fix us. The only suggestion they have is having the Wish spell cast upon us. Wish is 1000 platinum coins per person. The clerk once more recomends therapy to those it might help.
-   Distia gets another ping on her sending stone, asking if they should give the panthragoon quest to a different party. We decide to take the quest. When we arrive at the quest site, night is falling, so we decide to camp out for the night and attack in the morning.
-   We do night watch. Distia summons an owl to help keep watch. Which it does, but, as ordered, it didn't wake anyone up when it noticed the panthragoons. After the third watch, Asteria and Distia awake from their trances, at which point Distia's owl tells Distia that the party has been watched. Alma also notices the panthragoons at that time.
-   Something something DM warns us to not fight, because the cats will cause a TPK. Thankfully, we have druid, and a party memeber who has the Speak With Animals spell, so hopefully this will be the first peaceful encounter..
-   Combat rounds begin!
-   Distia and Rattamis talk with the cats. Humans are hunting their food, making them not so happy. They claim to have never attacked a 'two legged creature' before. They demand 10,000 pounds of meat, or they will hunt the party. We could also try to repopulate the forest with cows.
-   We agree to give them 10 cows a week, for the next 10 weeks. (1 cow costs 120 gold)
-   Alpha panthragoon also tells us that the humans who have been hunting the wild cows can be found downriver.
-   We went to the town and spoke with the village elder about the Panthragoons (cats) (Town is Westvale)
-   The cows started going missing. Cats started stealing food about the same time that food imports stopped due to the Derro Pirates. The pirates caused a food shortage. A lot of the food that would be sent to the guilds had to stop, because they had no food to send. The guilds had to resort to eating monsters. One of the two villages supplying food for the whole contintent. Them not being able to get imports led to them hunting a lot more.
-   Food trade will return to normal (supposedly) after the winter, so they only need to deal with increased hunting until the end of winter.
-   The central continent feeds the colleges as well.
-   An adventurer (bird) came to help deal with the problem. They should be in the pastures. Kenku. Named Boris. Spellcaster. Find him in the pastures, he might have more info for us.
-   Elder once more insists that we remove the kitties, saying that they are such a nuisance.
-   We return to the pastures to search for this Kenku. We find Boris pretty easily.
-   Something something Alma has been replaced with Boris...?
-   Around 50 cows were taken away. "They" came like shadows and whisked them away.
-   Shadows took the cows. They shadows appeared out of nowhere, and left very discrete marks in the ground. Traces in the sand.. in this pasture of grass.
-   Also Boris is talking in a very dramatic way.
-   The shadows had whiskers. And the glistened in the light.
-   Boris joins the party! (do do-do doo!)
-   Boris' god is Che'dar (god of cheese)
-   Boris leads the way, guided by Che'dar. (?) We arrive at Blackshire, the town of thieves. Boris leads us to a cow breeder, where we can buy cows.
-   We get the cows. Boris gets us a sale with his.. eloquent speech.
-   We deliver the 10 cows to the Panthragoons. Alma is nowhere to be found. The Panthragoon leader gives us two scales. One small one to give to the guild, and a large scale that can be used to summon the cats.
-   We return to the guild and submit the quest completion. For our speedy completion, we get a double reward (roll two d20's for our reward)
-   At the guild Boris' name is added to the party roster.
-   Bonus rewards:
    -   Asteria: none
    -   Boris (previously Alma): armour
    -   Distia: Wonderous item
    -   Ogo: none
    -   Rattamis: shield
    -   Ryuzen: none
    -   Tyrah: none
    -   Vevinier: none
-   We level up to level 3!

## Session 11 - May 02 2025

-   Sidequests begin
-   Distia and Rattamis' subclass quests happen today
-   We venture to the eastern island for the sidequests
-   We venture to the druid school for Distia's subclass quest.
-   The creatures there will not hurt us, but will make us wish to hurt them.
-   Three trials: puzzle, riddle, and dream visions
-   We begin with dream visions portion.
-   Ocean with hand reaching out, sandy beach, starry constellations in the sky above
-   Staying within the dream realm is very dangerous. We have 1 hour to escape.
-   Taking a step forward, the constellations in the sky above change slightly. Taking a step in any direction causes all the contellations to move chatoically.
-   Wisdom saving throws - Rattamis and I fail. The fail causes us to wander to the wrong path. Distia calls us to rejoin her on the correct path and feels a sense of rightousness (insight)
-   Distia notices that the stars are in the wrong places.
-   (Perception) some stars are shining brighter than others, and the locations of some constellations is incorrect. Some constellations shouldn't be visible given the current time of year, yet they are visible.
-   Boris is still _really_ funny
-   We know that we need to get three specific constellations in the sky (Draco, Virgo, Leo), but have no idea how to get them in the sky. Moving around gets the stars to shift randomly, but it's not consistent.
-   We must get to the silvery ocean!
-   We all get out.. except for Rattamis who get stuck in the dream realm for a while.
-   Distia (and therefore the rest of us as well) proceed to the riddle section next.
-   Three riddles
    -   Number 1: "I dance but have no feet, I rise but leave no ground. I can guide the lost and blind, yet none can catch or bind. What am I?" Answer: star
    -   Number 2: "I burn without fire, I shine without fuel. I mark both death and life, A beacon and a jewel. What am I?" Answer: a star
    -   Number 3: "Born of fire, robed in night, I lead lost travelers home by sight. But try to grasp, and I am gone. What am I?" Answer: northern star
-   We spent like, 30 IRL minutes drawing lines in a star map
-   Distia subclass quest complete! We move on to Rattamis'
-   Rattamis goes about his subclass quest solo
-   Does some dice rolling
-   Rattamis subclass quest complete

## Session 12 - May 09 2025

-   We return to the main continent (from the eastern continent).
-   We go to the tavern to pick up Tyrah (who wasn't here last session, and thus stayed behind at the main continent during last session).
-   On the main continent, we aim to complete Asteria's subclass quest.
-   Asteria is shown to a massive clockwork tower (the axis pendulum) that has a real big clock in it. Asteria must fix a cog of time, a cog of matter, a cog of law, and a cog of soul.
-   Riddle for the cog of time: Time splinters for the uncertains minds, the path that remains is not the one you'd hope for, but the one you ought to prevent.
-   We solved the cog of time riddle. The answer was village number 2.
-   Second riddle, cog of matter. It's another drawing riddle.
-   One piece is "Upward movement of structure"
-   Support the center vertically
-   Hexagon is fixed order
-   Symmetry with left
-   lateral balance
-   vertical symmetry
-   reflects opposite of top left
-   pushes towards the center from below
-   I enjoyed the solving of the puzzle, but upon seeing the explanation, I decided I didn't like the puzzle.
-   Next cog, the cog of law. We get a riddle! "The law is perfect, the world is not, therefore, interpret"
-   One answer is logical, the others are not. Identify the logical one.
-   We finish Asteria's subclass quest.
-   We also do Tyrah's subclass quest - Tyrah gets cured of being obsessed with the fireball book.

## Session 13 - May 16 2025

-   Mine and Ryuzen's subclass' today!
-   Ryuzen does theirs first.
-   Best for last, my subclass quest!
-   We played around and did a 2v2 with the members. I was the last one standing.
-   Then we faught some random mobs the DM threw at us

## Session 14 - May 23 2025

-   Rattamis and Ryuzen aren't here for session tonight
-   The bastion quest begins! (also we pray that we don't get TPKed)
-   It is the night of the full moon. A raven calls to Asteria and speaks in her mind; "May the light of the moon guide you to the bastion"
-   Boris buys a lot of liquor. 15 bottles of wine to be precise.
-   At the entrance to the Bastion (think medieval castle) that the God has guided us to, we find four shadow dire wolves, and one alhpa shadow dire wolf.
-   Big bad alpha wolf frightens the party, and the frighten sticks around for a bit.
-   Shadow wolves are strong again slashing (seem to be strong against all weapon attack types). They also have resistance against radiant damage, but are not resistant to fire damage.
-   Fight doesn't go well. Boris, Asteria and I are all down. Distia takes her chance and flees the battle, only for the alpha to chase her and take her unconsious as well.
-   Aaaaaaaand we TPK
-   And then, we wake up in the tavern the next morning..
-   The events seem to have never happened. The items we used are returned to us, etc. But, Asteria, the one who was given the quest, is missing.
-   As Distia wakes up, she sees a vision of a dragon's tail piercing Asteria's heart. The cost of failing the god's quest.
-   Asteria is confirmed dead - they'll be making a new character

## Session 15 - May 30 2025

-   We awake, paralyzed by fear.
-   As time passes, the fear fades. As our senses come back to us, we hear a slow dripping sound.
-   I'm the first of the party to get out of bed, and as I look out, I see blood slowly running out from under one of the doors from the female side of the bedrooms.
-   I knock on the door and shout out for the rest of the party that there might be a situation afoot.
-   The rest of the party joins me to investigate.
-   We open the door to see Asteria, her limbs only barely attatched to her torso, and a gian hole is in the middle of her.
-   Distia attempts to cast Cure Wounds to no avail.
-   As we stand around Asteria's corpse, we hear a voice speak in our minds "Mortals, you have witnessed what happens when you fail a god's quest." Asteria's body begins to fade into shadows. (by the way, Ogo heard the god's voice as chibi as well)
-   Dista enters a state of panic and attempts to grab a memento of Asteria's. But, grabs nothing but air as her body fully vanishes. Asteria's blood remains though.
-   [insert chaos from second madness where I see everyon as chibi versions]
-   Boris prays to Che'dar and runs away crying.
-   Distia slaps the madness out of me. (it quickly became not so fun, especially given the dark atmosphere brought about by Asteria's death)
-   Ryuzen wakes up and, upon seeing all the blood everyone and on everyone, goes to cry in a corner.
-   Rattamis pulls Ogo away and informs Ogo that Asteria is dead, taken away by the god who gave us the quest.
-   Rattamis and Distia have a bit of a heart-to-heart. (Also Distia thinks that she's invisible, and so is internally surprised that Rattamis can see here)
-   Distia stands up and announces that we should inform the barkeep about what happened.
-   Ryuzen is still very emotionally distraught (more madness madness!), but regains some composure and follows Distia out the end of the hall, where Boris went (towards the main floor).
-   Distia is still _very_ upset with Ogo. He follows behind at a distance.
-   Upon getting to the main floor, we see Boris slap 30 gp on the counter and ask for a lot of alcohol. He's given a very large keg, which he starts drinking from with a straw.
-   Distia informs the owner of Asteria's demise.
-   Tyrah quietly orders a chicken from the bar.
-   Boris quickly passed out, very drunk (after all of 2 drinks). Distia checks on him and arranges him to make him a bit more comfortable.
-   Ogo thanks Velvyra (the owner) for the advice she gave to Distia, and then moves to sit at a table where Distia isn't (huzzah for social awkardness)
-   We give give Boris the nickname "Mr. Kathunk"
-   Distia calls for a group meeting.
-   Distia informs the party that this whole adventuring thing is too much for her. She announces that she will be leaving the group.
-   We bid our farewells to Distia.
-   We all slowly stare at Tyrah, the last female of the party, as she eats her chicken.
-   Distia's new character, an elf named Seralyth, forces herself to join the table.
-   Ogo questions her sanity at wanting to join _this_ group of all groups after listening to Distia's farewell.
-   Tyrah offers a chicken leg.
-   Seralyth recognizes the esteemed acolyte of Che'dar, and slaps him out of his drunken sleep.
-   Ogo quickly becomes friendly with Seralyth. A welcome addition to the party!
-   Boris and Seralyth have a history. Something about Seralyth always killing people, and Che'dar liking Seralyth more than Boris. Seralyth then starts eating cheese in front of Boris. Boris responds by opening up his cloak and a cheese wheel falls out. Seralyth grabs it out of the air and begins eating it too.
-   ... talks of cult ensues.
-   Something something Boris calls Seralyth a hag, and that death always follows her. Seralyth tells boris to stop being so melodramatic (paraphrasing)
-   Seralyth and Tyrah share a handshake as Seralyth joins the team, much to Boris' dismay.
-   Boris gives a prophecy that allowing Seralyth to join, and even worse if she leads, will only lead to the group's doom.
-   As Seralyth stands, a poster proclaiming faith to Che'dar falls from her bags.
-   Boris keep calling Seralyth a hag.
-   New Ryuzen lore! Ryuzen likes checkers!
-   Upon Seralyth being selected as party leader, she claps her hands together in a fashion, eerily similar to how Distia would, and calls for everyone to venture to the Adventurer's guild to get signed up at the guild. Do party registration and stuff and head off on a quest.
-   Post session, Boris and Tyrah got some items (one each) to bring them up to more or less the party average.
