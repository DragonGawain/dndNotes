## Session 1 - Jan 16, 2026

- We find ourselves dead, and suddenly standing before the gods. We hear them speak in an androgynous voice, the voice ringing in our minds.
- The gods inform us that they have summoned us in their time of need, and apologize for interrupting whatever sort of time we might be having.
- One by one, the gods speak to us and lend us their power (along with some items!). They also give us clothes. Cause, y'know, we didn't have any of those.
- I'm not keeping track of what everyone asked for and got.
- Marian, the only one of us who has decided to multiclass from start, gets some special RP scenery.
- After we get our stuff, we're dropped from high into the sky onto the planet. We crash into a magic circle which shatters upon impact with it. Some of the mages standing around the circle drop dead the moment we touch it.
- A king with heteocrohmatic eyes sees us land, sighs, and begins to walk away before we can even stand up.
- The items that the gods gifted us appear a lot less glamorous than they did a moment ago. The gods also leave us with a parting message: "enjoy the strength of a level 20 adventurer".
- After a moment longer, we see the magic circle glow bright once more. We feel our strength return to us, yet take something away at the same time.
- One of the mages tells us that we are in Bastion Carne. They failed the summoning the first time, and, apparently due to our 'weaker' energy, they conclude that they have failed again.
- Upon being questioned, they reply that they attempted to summon legendary heroes, of power level 20. But we are mere power level 3, as confirmed by a crystal ball.
- Still panting, the mage continues: great heroes, we do not mean offense to you at all for summoning you, but our land is in great need of assistance.
- Since we are not the great heroes they attempted to summon, we will need to power ourselves up. The.. remains of the adventurers guild still remains and offers quests.
- They ask that, whenever we head out of the settlement, to map the area around us.
- They offer us houses to settle in.
- The king left earlier. A queen exists but is seldom seen. Artisans exist around town to help us. Three blacksmiths (names in NPC channel) Light weapon specialist, normal weapon specialist, heavy weapon specialist. 3 armourers: light armour specialist, medium armour specialist, heavy armour specialist. Master tanner, accepting leathers, hides, monster skins, etc. Willing to turn raw stuff into useable materials. Lumberjacks: gatherer of rare woods and special trees, processor specialist. 2 jewlers: ring, amulet, wonderous items specialist. Arcane specialist. two alchemists: potions (healing, resistance), **DON'T BUY FROM CRONK**, Cronk makes potions that no one knows what they do. 4 fletchers: bow specialis (short, long), crossbow specialst, firearm specialist, amunition of bolts and arrows, bullets. 4 farmers tending to crops. 2 fishermen out in the woods to the east and west. And other random blokes doing.. regular bloke stuff around the town. And a military force 60 strong.
- The mages around us start picking up the dead bodies around us, and pick up Thane as well, who is pretending to be dead, ready to be shipped of to the crematorium. That makes him stop his act _real_ quick.
- We all chose our settlement of choice.
- We enjoy a meal made by Renna, accompanied by burnt bread baked by Jacques. Thane runs around outside and rips a tree out of the ground. The knights are.. unamused by this.
- Thane goes back and and runs around looking for the knight who told him to put the tree down. They engage in a uhh, "duel", where Thane did shockingly well.
- Sir Tharock Grimbrand grows to like Thane a bit.
- He also gives Veil a stern warning about trying to sneak around town.

## Session 2 - Jan 23, 2026

- In the guild hall, there are tools on standby: a pickaxe (for mining quests), a special axe (for logging quests), special knife (tanning quests), 2 herbalism kits, and cartographer tools.
- Though most of us do not recognize the material of the tools, they are, in fact, made out of mythril.
- Any world locations that the wednesday group reveals, we can also see, and vice-versa.
- Ground rules for world exploration: every 5 miles, we roll for a random encounter. If the tile is illuminated (mapped), the chance for an encounter is halved. Every successful encounter, we get a single free pass - we can chose to skip the next encounter if we want to.
- Renna takes the cartography tools, Eren takes the herbalism kit, Artemis takes the skinning knife, and the pickaxe and axe get pushed onto Thane, despite his claims that he could just rip a tree out of the ground.
- When harvesting materials, one person, without any buffs, will rolls for how much of it we obtain.
- We can trade materials for other materials of equal rarity (i.e. one iron ore for one log of equal rarity)
- One of the knights visits Veil. Despite her protests, Reinna opens the door. Politely.(chronologically, this happened on one of the days between last session and this one). The knight apologizes for Sir Grimbrand's behaviour, and also gives a warning that everyone is expected to be within their homes before midnight. Failure to be in your house after midnight twice will result in being thrown in jail. Reinna relays this information to the party.
- Dark tile => d10 for encounter, light tile => d20 for encounter
- I manage to stumble us upon an army of infinite jackals. The DM has us skip the encounter.
- I stumble across another army of infinite small weak creatures. Hawks this time. THis encounter was also skipped.
- I then stumble across two gold dragons. This encounter actually happens! Yippee! (sarcasm)
- Combat begins! We roll stealth to see if we can sneak away. Everyone except Reinna passes the stealth check.
- I convince the dragons to leave with the power of baguettes.
- Once more, the power of The Baguette has been demonstrated in full glory!
- We then run into 18 elk!
- We use our mulligan from 'beating' the dragon encounter to skip this. We decide to skip the fight of 18 elk because of the sheer number of them and that our AOE sorcerer isn't with us (they disconnected)
- After a bit of getting lost in the lower mountains, we encounter our target, the polar serpent!
- The snake can apparently uhh, fly. So it flys up right into our faces!
- The baguette strikes the finishing blow against the mighty serpent! And then it becomes a pile of ash and gets swept away in the wind.
- We all try to take a look around to see if we can find any evidence of the creature, but the only signs of its existence that we find is the imprint in the snow of where we originally saw it..
- On our way back from fighting the serpent (we decide to hit up the iron mine the other party located, then map out the area to the west of the bastion), we get ambushed by a Bulette. It leaps out of the mountains, knocks Reinna down in a single slap, and then chomp down on Thane. Twice.
- Eren manages to put it to sleep, at which point we all run away from it.
- Eren (team MVP of this encounter!) also casts Cure Wounds to heal up Reinna back from the dead. Marian also force feed Reinna a goodberry.
- Turns out, the guild info was a wee bit wrong. As we _also_ encounter a manticore (the other group killed a manticore on their quest, and the guild thought there was only one of them..). Also there's three manticores.
- Combat begins!
- I lead the charge (for honour and bread!) at one of the manticores and stab it real good.
- As we defeat the manticores, they, much like the polar serpent, also turn into black ash and fade away. It seems that might just be a rule of the world..
- We manage to defeat the three manticores with no deaths! (though I'm dow to 3 hp...).
- We collect 20 iron ore! (Thane is strong)
- We fail to map any of the area on our way southwest back to the bastion from the iron mine.
- We make it back into town safely! (after I fed that duo of dragons some more bread)

## Session 3 - Jan 30, 2026

- We depart for the logging quest! We can go either north west, or to the east.
- We decide to go east in case we encounter the pack of saber tooth tigers, as they are growing in number, and it would be better to encounter them sooner rather than later. Let the record show that Reinna voted that we go north-west to avoid the chance of encountering the tigers.
- We get ambushed by a Shambling Mound (it looks like a bunch of tree roots with glowy yellow eyes)
- It deals lightning damage (good to know I guess)
- Tree.. tentacle (not tendril lol) monster... Yeah this thing looks creepy.
- It's also resistant to fire.
- Eren summons Cloud Of Daggers, and this shambling mound, with its grand -3 intelligence, gets the great idea to swing Thane, who it has grappled and restrained, into the cloud of daggers.
- Meanwhile, I've started to learn how to play rogues, run in, do the stabby stab, then bonus action disengage and run away.
- It's _also_ resistant to cold damage.
- It's _not_ resistant to radiant damage though! It does seem to be resistant to a lot of elemental damage though.
- Not weak to acid damage!
- Thane and Eren go down, and then it goes and picks me up.
- The Baguette proves his worth in battle once more! (I dealt the BULK of the damage this fight, dealing 18 damage each of my attacks, except for my final blow against it, where I got a nat 20 and dealt 19 damage instead (would have been 36 but I don't have sneak attack dice for the attack))
- We limp back to the bastion, terribly wounded, but all alive.
- The quest results in a failure, but at least we're all still alive!

## Session 4 - Feb 12, 2026

- On Wednesday, 5 of the wednesday group heard the southern gate open, and saw two of the archmages and two of the arch-paladins escorting a hooded figure into the bastion.
- They were told to return to their houses, and decided to not listen and got beaten up a whole bunch. Including some casts of meteor storm.
- And Veil happened to see this all.
- In the morning, everyone except Errandor and Grunt's door's were beaten in. They were sent out at 8:00 AM, instead of the normal noon, and told that if they didn't complete their mission, they'd be brought into the mage tower and subject to electric shock therapy.
- Their adventure lasted 13.5 hours. When they got back, meteor storm was cast on them again.
- Turns out the Queen has some 9th level tantrums..
- The wednesday group found the tindlewood logging sight! They also found the orcs. The orcs sent back a message as well: 'If anyone from the bastion "accidentally" walks into our territory again, then we will "accidentally" siege the bastion.'
- The wednesday group also found teh gnolls. Southwest of the bastion, hunting because winter is harder.
- They are this far north because they had to cross the "black scary castly" and "rocky mountain aztec"
- The Swanmay tribe has also been located, a supplier of medicinal herbs. But, the normal bridge to get to them has been disintegrated.
- So, with that catchup out of the way, we go to the logging site to collect some lumber!
- And encounter a duo of werewolves along the way.
- We had a lovely sidebar discussion about role playing, and playing as the character, and not playing meta and doing the 'optimal' action.
- So, we beat the two werewolves, but Reinna died in combat.
- We come out of the adventure with 4 logs of tindlewood lumber.
- Since only one party member died, they can summon a new hero next week. But, if another hero dies before the week is over (i.e. someone from the wednesday campaign), then there might be complications.
