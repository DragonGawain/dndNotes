- We are currently in the second campaign that I've played with this group, the Space Aids campaign.

- You can find the bulk of the notes in [story.md](https://github.com/DragonGawain/dndNotes/blob/main/Space%20Aids/story.md).

- My DM streams the campaign! You can catch the streams on his twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dzurek. I play in the Friday group, starting at 7:00 PM EST. There's also a Wednesday group, which also starts at 7:00 PM EST.
